# Md To Html

To convert a md file using github link, **click on Raw** on github and then copy the link of the raw file.

A direct link to the rendered md file page will not work, it need the raw file.

The whole content of the md file is put inside the **container** div.

**Index** is automatically created with links to the headings.

The index elements is a list element with class specified according to the heading type.

The class name for heading can be used to style the index.

Tables, links, images, code, sample code are all converted to html element.

Code blocks can be style/highlighted with any highliter such as **[highlightjs](https://highlightjorg/")**

Example of **formatting css** that can be seen on this page [download](https://adwait.in/assets/).

All the Notes on this website were first created as md and then converted to html with this tool.
